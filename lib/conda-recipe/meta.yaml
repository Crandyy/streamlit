  # TODO(vdonato): Figure out a way to replace `python` in the script run below
  # with ``{{ PYTHON }}`` so that conda uses its own Python installation
  # instead of the system installation. It turns out we've been incorrectly
  # using the system installation all this time, which caused the `imports`
  # test to start failing since it uses the conda installation (and our
  # streamlit package is installed in the system installation). However, trying
  # to use the conda python installation to build this package ends up running
  # into some errors that I haven't been able to diagnose, so we just get rid
  # of the import test for now and verify that we can install and import the
  # conda package in a separate test.
